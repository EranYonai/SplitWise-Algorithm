# SplitWise-Algorithm
Simple console based Split Wise algorithm to split payments between friends.

Split Wise script & Algorithm, from what I know there are two approaches to solving this problem:
1. Greedy Algorithm
2. Dynamic Programming

According to Splitwise themselves, the greedy algorithm is the best approach.

And the rules are (according to SplitWise):
1. Everyone owes the same net amount at the end,
2. No one owes a person that they didnâ€™t owe before, and (which is not as important imo)
3. No one owes more money in total than they did before the simplification.
