# Split Wise script & Algorithm, from what've read there are two approaches to solving this problem
# 1. Greedy Algorithm
# 2. Dynamic Programming
# According to Splitwise themselves, the greedy algorithm is the best approach.
# And the rules are:
# 1. Everyone owes the same net amount at the end,
# 2. No one owes a person that they didnâ€™t owe before, and (which is not as important imo)
# 3. No one owes more money in total than they did before the simplification.
